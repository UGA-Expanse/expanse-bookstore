## Getting Started

To install this application, run the following commands:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/devRobots/spring-boot-ecommerce.git spring-boot-ecommerce
cd uga-expanse-bookstore
```

This will get a copy of the project installed locally. To configure all of its dependencies and start each app, follow the instructions below.

### Configure Database

Once MySQL is installed you must configure a username and password. By default the user and password should be `root` . If not, you must configure in the file `application.configure` located in the path `src/main/resources/`.

In the file `application.configure` you must edit the parameters `spring.datasource.username` and `spring.datasource.password` with the values you defined.

### Create Database & Tables

Now you just need to create the database where the project will store the information. To create it, just follow the steps below.

```bash
mysql -u {username} -p
```

This command will ask for your MySQL password. Once inside the MySQL monitor you can create the database with the following command.

```SQL
CREATE DATABASE `uga-expanse-db` ;
```

Now you can run the server which generates the database tables. To run the server, run:

```bash
./gradlew spring-boot:run
```

### Create admin user

Before continuing you must create the user `admin`, in order to perform administrator operations in the application. For this you must create a user on the MySQL monitor with the following command.

```SQL
USE expansedb;
INSERT INTO user (username, email, is_admin, password) values ('{admin.username}', '{admin.email}', true, '{admin.password}');
```

### Run Frontend Client

Now you can run the frontend client to use the web application. To run the client, run:

```bash
cd expanse-frontend
yarn start
```
